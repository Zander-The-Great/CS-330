1.)
How do I approach designing software?
-For me I start from the ground up. If we have a solid foundation it will give us the groundwork to build off of.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
-Since this was more of a state based enviornment compared to a object based it was important to have specific functions to utilize and call. Sometimes we may call multiple times
so it comes in handy.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
-I started by looking at the big picture and understanding what the end goal was. It was at this point I started to pose small steps to get to that end goal.
By integrating this step by step basis it allowed me to track my progression and work on specifics.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I feel as though I take a similar approach everytime I work on a coding project. Whats the big picture, what are the steps to get there. Sometimes its best to 
separate the big steps into smaller ones. 




2.)
How do I approach developing programs?
- Like I stated above its good to get the big picture and what the requirements are listed out so you can track your progress.
- once we have those down we can list the steps/building blocks necessary to get there.


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- I stumbled a few times working on these projects. The biggest thing was utilizing ALL of the resources we have on hand. My best stratiegy was to walk away and come back 
- with fresh eyes and mind. This allowed my to thing about the issues I was dealing with at hand and ponder the logic of it all. This is where alot of my breakthroughs came into play.
- There were alot of times I tried to push through and didnt get anywhere. Just trying things until it worked. Breaks are very important as this is where alot of breakthroughs come from
- Using reasourses, taking breaks, asking questions are all solid fundimentals to make sure we are successful.
- Lastly admitting to ourselves we need help or get stuck. No one likes to admit it and its great to show your work. But know when you need help. Alot of projects require teamwork.
- as long as you do your due diligance and show your work alot of the times you just need a pointer in the right direction to get you where you need to be.

How did iteration factor into your development?
-in terms of iteration from one to the next all shows the completion of my project. Looking back at my milestones and seeing the iteration progress and build into something was very cool. Each one showed the process from basic rendering, to multiple renders, to textures, lighting, and bringing it all together.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
- Like mentioned above Looking back on all of this was really amazing and rewarding. I went into this with alot of it above my head.
- taking the steps of recognizing the big picture to mapping out the steps of progression really helped my progression.
- Much like other classes and projects doing your homework problems and readings along with doing my side reading/research helped make this progress smoother.
- There were times I got stuck and asked my professor for help and he pointed me in the right direction.
- There were also issues I was facing outside of class and this project which effected my timelines/missed/messed up due dates. Working with my professor and keeping the communication open really helped me to be successful. It made me feel like apart of a great team to be able to have the flexibility to reach our goals.
- These are all things I have worked on and evolved overtime. Being closed minded and cut off only hurts yourself. Stay open minded and use communication and you will reach your goals



3.)
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-Computer science is such an open field and it really is endless in terms of technology. It helps me think outside of the box and perform logic. This critical thinking is very benificial.
-Especially in my current job where I and a network and systems tech. Granted the stuff I focus on is different its the mentality that comes with it. There are alot of things I can use interchangably. Knowledge is power!

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-This has given me a great perspective. This is a part of the field that I have always had an interest in but never got to experiance.
-There is a bit of a learning curve. But once you get over the hump it starts to make sense. 
-Depedning on the enviornment I am coding in I can now take my coding to another level. This will allow me to bring a move visual aspect to my code and will allow those who run my code a more interactive experiance.
-I am sure alot of us have been into video games and this is just scratching the surface of what we can integrate. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
- As far as professional paths go I am still unsure which direction I will go. 
- I do have a great interest in coding, but I have always been more on the networking and switches side of things. 
- Setting up servers ect. I am excited to see where I end up. But soon I will make my choice to where I go next.
